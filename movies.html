                               that beautifully captures that feeling of longing but you cannot explain why. With beautiful animation and an amazing score by the RADWIMPS,
                                Shinkai explores a body swapping scenario between a city boy and country girl both longing for each other's lifestyle only to subvert expectations
                                and take you on a beautiful journey from start to finish.</p>

                            But Peele's extensive experience in skit comedy on his popular show <i>Key and Peele</i> absolutely shines, and his masterful conducting of pace
                            and tone leaves you immersed and invested the whole time. </p>

                            <p class="card-text"> Parasite, the winner of best film of the year 2020, is a South Korean black comedy thriller film by Bong Joon-ho
                            that was my personal best film of the year as well. It delves into topics such as the wealth gap, class conflicts, and social inequality.
                            Topics that are universal, and not only a statement in South Korea, but in the US as well. Joon-Ho juxtaposes 2 different families and
                            an easy-going sleazy family befriends a wealthy families home in order to all be employed by them and benefit from their wealth without their
                            knowledge but halfway through the film takes a turn that you have to go in blind to experience. </p>

                            <p class="card-text"> Mad Max: Fury Road is somewhat of a reboot of the original trilogy starring Mel Gibson in the 1980s, with Tom Hardy taking
                                the mantle of the titular character. Fury Road is another chapter in Max's story, a ghost haunted by his past changing the lives of everyone he
                                crosses paths with, known as the Road warrior. Miller's love for practical effects and show not tell story telling that led to amazing world building
                                rivaling even Star Wars, Fury Road is my absolute favorite action film.

                            <p class="card-text">Edgar Wright's Baby Driver is nothing short of another example why he leads the industry in making every scene
                            engaging and having 0 dull moments. A story of Baby, a heist driver wanting to turn away from the life he has led because of love, it follows
                                a boy that was in the wrong place at the wrong time but is damn good at driving.
                                He makes even Baby getting coffee an absolute blast to watch and an example of well paced
                            and fun cinema. An example of what Fast and Furious could be given the right direction.</p>

                            <p class="card-text">The Big Lebowski by the Cohen Brothers is what I would call an anti-movie. Almost like the Seinfeld of cinema
                            where nothing really happens but it somehow drags you along a strange mystery led by the most unqualified group of people imaginable
                                that unravels but is somehow only secondary to the primary
                            plot of Lebowski just trying to bowl and smoke weed. The way the Cohen Brothers approach dialogue and story telling that is nonchalant in
                            its delivery makes for a weird but extremely funny experience.</p>
